# Objeck
Objeck is an object-oriented computer language with functional features. The language has ties with Java, Scheme and UML. In this language all data types, except for higher-order functions, are treated as objects.

Objeck contains all of the features of a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis placed on simplicity. The programming environment consists of a compiler, virtual machine and command line debugger.

## Example
```ruby
class Hello {
  function : Main(args : String[]) ~ Nil {
    "Hello World"->PrintLine();
    "Καλημέρα κόσμε"->PrintLine();
    "こんにちは 世界"->PrintLine();
  }
}
```
